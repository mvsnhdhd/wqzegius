		<p>You can visualize yourselfliving in harmony with this mission and gaining Daily Personal Victories.  The reasons that motivate you to do this are the driving forces to level up.  The source of all four life-supporting factors is the twisted and constantly changing social mirror, which engenders a high dependence on the changing moods, feelings, attitudes and behavior of others.  Organizations do not have to depend on external circumstances; they can take the initiative to realize the values ​​and goals of the people they unite.  And its whole point is to shift responsibility.  Definition of proactivity Having discovered the fundamental principle of human nature, Frankl described his own accurate map, on the basis of which he began to develop the first and most important skill of a person who is highly effective in all circumstances - the skill of proactivity. </p>

		<p>Additional pressure was exerted on them by the press.  Thus, demand is the desire and ability of buyers to purchase goods and services at certain prices, which can be written in the form of the formula: D = P? Q, where P is the price; Q is the number of goods and services.The graph contains seven options for demand for a product, depending on its price.  Patent law deals with industrial property, i.e.  PRODUCTION FUNCTION, PRODUCTION FORCES,PRODUCTION RELATIONS A production function is the efficient release of products from different factors of production.  EFFECT OF INCOME AND EFFECT OF SUBSTITUTION One and the same consumer can afford to buy a larger amount of a cheaper product.  The functions of state bodies are separate areas in the content of their practical activities.  Direct methods include financing R&D and innovation projects from budgetary funds, protecting the rights of participants in innovative activities (creating a state patent and licensing system), creating a state innovation infrastructure and an innovation market, training qualified personnel, as well as moral support for innovation (awarding outstanding scientists and innovators with state awards, honorary titles, etc.).  Forms of individual enterprises: 1) individual labor activity (based on their own labor); 2) individual private enterprise (labor of hired workers is used).  And usually these scenarios differ from each other.  But this is not enough for true success.  Highly effective people recognize this responsibility.  To mitigate the negative impact of risk, an insurance reserve is created.  We have doubled our income and quadrupled our profits.  For many, such events seem unusual, completely uncharacteristic of human life, almost a miracle. </p>

		<p>Functional wear is caused by a change in the range of products, which leads to the fact that the existing specialized equipment remains unloaded.Renovation is the process of changing an object in accordance with the latest requirements and norms, for example, modernizing the production process, technical equipment, etc.  The conceptual framework of government regulation is a theory that acquires the status of government doctrine.Alternative conceptual approaches to state redistribution of income can be reduced to the problem of opposing equality and efficiency.  Habits can be mastered, or you can get rid of them.  Empathic listening in itself is a tremendous contribution to the Emotional Banking Account.  The marginal rate of substitution of good X for good Y measures the consumer's desire (propensity) to exchange one product for another.  The Quadrant II approach in this case may be to study the problem to see if it is chronic, persistent.  The structure of the physical capital market is distinguished by a high frequency and an extreme variety of the quality of objects of exchange.  By setting different prices depending on the terms of purchase, the firm actually segments the single market for a product by purchasing options.  You look at things differently than reactive people, and therefore you think and act differently.You are looking at the world through a fundamental paradigm of effective living. </p>
